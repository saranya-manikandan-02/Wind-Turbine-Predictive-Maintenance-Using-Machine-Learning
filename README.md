# Wind-Turbine-Predictive-Maintenance-Using-Machine-Learning
This project explores the application of machine learning for predictive maintenance of wind turbines, focusing on the crucial geartrain component. With 76% of wind turbine failures occurring in the gearbox, this study investigates its fault scenarios and proposes a predictive maintenance system.
